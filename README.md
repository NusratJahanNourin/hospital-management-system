Project Overview
The Hospital Management System is designed to handle various entities and their relationships within a hospital environment. It exposes REST endpoints under the /api base path for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and additional functionalities like filtering and status updates. The system is modular, with each entity (e.g., Patient, Doctor, Appointment) having dedicated controllers and services, ensuring separation of concerns and scalability.
